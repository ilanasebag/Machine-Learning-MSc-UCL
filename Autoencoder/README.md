# Autoencoders

The auto-encoder is a specific type of neural network with a symmetric architecture of hidden layers. It consists of 3 components: encoder, code and decoder. The encoder compresses the input and produces the code and the decoder reconstructs the input. 
## I. Denoising Autoencoder on Fashion-MNIST
In this notebook, we aim to add noise to the data and analyse the performance of the autoencoder on the noisy data.
